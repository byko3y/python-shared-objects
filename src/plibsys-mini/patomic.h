 * @brief Atomic operations
 * @author Alexander Saprykin
 *
 * Atomic operations can be used to avoid heavy thread synchronization
 * primitives such as mutexes, semaphores and so on. These operations are
 * performed atomically and can't be preempted by another thread.
 *
 * Lock-free atomic operations require software and hardware support. Usually
 * lock-free atomic operations are implemented with low-level using assembly
 * inlines. Some of the compilers provide built-in routines to perform atomic
 * operations. You can use the p_atomic_is_lock_free() call to check whether
 * such a support is provided or not.
 *
 * If there is no hardware or software support for lock-free atomic operations
 * then they can be simulated (though in rather slower manner) using a thread
 * global synchronization primitive (i.e. mutex), but it could block threads
 * while performing atomic operations on distinct variables from distinct
 * threads.
 *
 * The Windows platform provides all the required lock-free operations in most
 * cases, so it always has lock-free support.
