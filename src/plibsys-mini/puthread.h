/**
 * @file puthread.h
 * @brief Multithreading support
 * @author Alexander Saprykin
 *
 * A thread is a system execution unit which is managed independently by the
 * scheduler of the operating system. It allows to do things in parallel or
 * concurrently.
 *
 * #PUThread provides a convinient way of multithreading support using native
 * routines to provide the best performance on the target system.
 *
 * To create the thread use the p_uthread_create() or p_uthread_create_full()
 * routines. Joinable threads allow to wait until their execution is finished
 * before proceeding further. Thus you can synchronize threads' execution within
 * the main thread.
 *
 * A reference counter mechanism is used to keep track of a #PUThread structure.
 * It means that the structure will be freed automatically when the reference
 * counter becomes zero. Use p_uthread_ref() to hold the structure and
 * p_uthread_unref() to decrement the counter back. A running thread holds a
 * reference to itself structure, so you do not require to hold a reference
 * to the thread while it is running.
 *
 * Priorities (if supported) allow to tune scheduler behavior: threads with
 * higher priority will be executed more frequently. Be careful that improper
 * priorities may lead to negative effects when some threads may receive almost
 * zero execution time.
 *
 * Thread priorities are unreliable: not all operating systems respect thread
 * priorities in favour of process ones. Priorities may be ignored for bound
 * threads (every thread bound to a kernel light-weight thread as 1:1), other
 * systems may require administrative privileges to change the thread priority
 * (i.e. Linux). Windows always respects thread priorities.
 *
 * To put the current thread (even if it was not created using the #PUThread
 * routines) in a sleep state use p_uthread_sleep().
 *
 * You can give a hint to the scheduler that the current thread do not need an
 * execution time with the p_uthread_yield() routine. This is useful when some
 * of the threads are in an idle state so you do not want to waste a CPU time.
 * This only tells to the scheduler to skip the current scheduling cycle for the
 * calling thread, though the scheduler can ingnore it.
 *
 * A thread local storage (TLS) is provided. The TLS key's value can be accessed
 * through a reference key defined as a #PUThreadKey. A TLS reference key is
 * some sort of a token which has an associated value. But every thread has its
 * own token value though using the same token object.
 *
 * After creating the TLS reference key every thread can use it to access a
 * local-specific value. Use the p_uthread_local_new() call to create the TLS
 * reference key and pass it to every thread which needs local-specific values.
 * You can also provide a destroy notification function which would be called
 * upon a TLS key removal which is usually performed on the thread exit.
 *
 * There are two calls to set a TLS key's value: p_uthread_set_local() and
 * p_uthread_replace_local(). The only difference is that the former one calls
 * the provided destroy notification function before replacing the old value.
 *
 * Thread names are used on most of operating systems for debugging puposes,
 * thereby some limitations for long name can be applied and too long names
 * will be truncated automatically.
